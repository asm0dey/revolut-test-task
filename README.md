# revolut-test-task

This task doesn't suit well to RESTful API, but I tried hard to mimic that it's fine.

## General usage

You can obtain basic understanding of API in tests (ApiTests class), but it should be used in flow like that:

1. Create account (`POST /account`) and get its id in response
2. Fullfill this account (`PATCH /account/{id}/fullfill/{amount}`)
3. Repeat for another accounts
4. Transfer money between them with (`PATCH /account/{from}/transfer/{to}/{amount}`)

All amounts are BigDecimals, so you can safely pass any numbers there

## Testing

Application is thoroughly tested, coverage is 100%. during build it's tested with mutation tests.

Also transfer logics is tested with massively-multithreaded test, which tries hard to create deadlocks. If it will succeed â€” test will fail bacause of timeout

I didn't write unit tests because on such scale 100% coverage by API tests doesn't require us to have unit tests in such simple business logics case.

## Running

```bash
./gradlew build
java --add-modules=java.xml.binf -jar build/libs/revolut-test-task-0.1-all.jar
```
